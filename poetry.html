            <h3>of an exchange between two on a rainy night</h3>
            <p>
                Throw away your soggy cigarette and ask me about my day.<br>
                Take a seat and smear with your finger the fuzz<br>
                of the meniscus of cold broth in a bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magnetise your bi-polar heart and show me where it points.<br>
                Guide me to the sea and explain<br>
                what you'll first fend off against:<br>
                the salt or the seaweed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where would you go<br>
                if you were to leave a trail of footsteps in the snow,<br>
                and weren't sure whether you'd come back the same or different?
            </p>
            <p>
            I want to dissect your mind and study your thoughts.<br>
            I will determine whether your spirit is as fragile as<br>
            a rose in vitro,<br>
            as a naïve heart,<br>
            as the truth,<br>
            or if it is as sturdy as<br>
            history,<br>
            as a violin string,<br>
            as glass—

            <h3>Once more</h3>
            <p>
                Once more, you came knocking on my door.<br>
                An even and predictable knock it was.<br>
                Every fortnight, more or less, you come.<br>
                A joy you instill that's worthy of applause.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you leave.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flowing animus, will thou aid me?<br>
                From me, embrace of hers slipped away again:<br>
                merciless, ruthless, rather graceful<br>
                departure. Love knows not of me — not of men.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what if?
            </p>
            <p>
                O episteme, will thou aid me?<br>
                Of no need is love that aches. Rationale knows.<br>
                In darkness, the wandering mind dies.<br>
                Only minds can fill other minds. Dispose!
            </p>
            <p>
                Veracity.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is virtuous in a patience that yields no fruit?<br>
                Perhaps, honour is in the heart of the resolute,<br>
                for only they have endured self-torture for an oath.<br>
                "The light of my life is worth more than my hurt," they quoth. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once more, I came knocking at your door.
