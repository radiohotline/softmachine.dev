I got so fucked up last night. I had just eaten dinner and went to get a drink.
I wanted to get soda but when I opened the fridge I saw the tasty minty lemonade
bottle. I took the bottle out, and I took a bottle of soda and a glass and set
them all on the table. I was breathing like a drug addict. After feeling stable
(there was some talk about the recent death in the background), I began by pouring
juice up to half of the glass. Then I opened the soda and poured lemon soda into
the rest of the glass. I began drinking, quickly. I loved that shit. I slurped it
up and felt too much of it in my mouth. Too tasty and fizzy. I felt sick. I
repeated the process. I drank it. My heart was beating so fast. There was a very
tiny bit of soda left so I slurped that. I felt sick. I had 1 million burps trapped
inside me that I were to release later
