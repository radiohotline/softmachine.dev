    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Teeth in Vitro started in 2021 under the name [REDACTED], where it solely held the Nirvana page until 2022, when I decided to
        reserve it for my portfolio. I promised it things that I never did. It was relaunched in 2024 as a much more
        compact personal website with the modest version you see here and the more extravagant companion that is planned with more "fun" design aspects and features.
        Both aim to express who I am to the world.<br><br>
        You pass by people every day and they don't leave an impression on you, and neither will I, but maybe I will leave a mark on the world as someone who merely
        existed.

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>Art and techy escapades, when I undertake the escapades. I am currently lacking in hardware. Essays may be shared if a topic lingers on my mind.</p>

    <p>The more I try to outline who I am, the more I lose grasp. I will contain a piece of my brain here.</p>

        Fruit bled in the palm<br>
        Streaking life across my skin<br>
        I am real again<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I'm an artist, musician, and programmer (I mainly use C), with a strong passion for music, computers (both CS and CE), experimental art, DIY, and other things.
        I am a linguistics student.
        <br><br>
        I love learning about everything. More persistent interests include: philosophy, music theory, literature, linguistics
        (and anthropology, even though I despise mankind and what it made), cryptanalysis, video games and game development, animation, filmmaking (especially directing),
        electronics, ham radio, dinosaurs, birdwatching, and, of course, computers.
        <br><br>
        I'm also fascinated by categorization, data archives and collections of basically anything, tools, trinkets, mechanisms, and musical instruments.
        A lot of my interests are off-shoots or combinations of each other, and my aspirations lay everywhere since my dream is to combine the things that
        I enjoy doing into a valuable creation.
