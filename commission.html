    <h3>Commercial Work</h3>

            <li>Commercial commissions I may take include the following:</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>Creator artwork: banners, icons, etc. for streamers and similar</li>

    <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
    <h4>General terms</h4>
    <ul>
	<li>Commission prices may be higher than listed depending on the complexity of the work requested.</li>
	<li>I retain the right to reject an order for any reason.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Payment</h4>
    <ul>
	    <li>Payments are done through BuyMeACoffee (linked above) and in USD.</li>
	    <li>I will first send a sketch when I accept the commission, and you may pay 50% of the total price as confirmation. When the work is completed, I will send a preview, and you may pay the remaining 50% as confirmation.  You may request a refund up until the sketch stage.</li>
	    <li>Please do not pay until I have accepted the commission and given you a slot. I will provide an ID for the commission for you to use during payment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Process and Delivery</h4>
    <ul>
	    <li>The time it takes to complete a commission may vary, but I can generally complete an order within a week <i>after making a sketch</i>. The time at which I start will depend on how many commissions I have taken. I may cancel the order if special circumstances occur, such as travel or illness. I will refund the order in that case.</li>
	    <li>When the commission is complete, I will email you the full-resolution image as a PNG or your preferred lossless format.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Revisions</h4>
    <ul>
	    <li>Minor changes (fixing errors, touching up the work, coloring changes, etc) to the commissioned work are free. Major changes (such as recreating a rendered background) that take more than an hour to do will cost up to %50 additional money depending on the workload. If the change is a result of a misunderstanding on my end (i.e. misreading or misinterpreting the written directions), there will be no extra costs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Licensing and Usage</h4>
    <ul>
	    <li>You may not use a personally commissioned work for commercial purposes, such as in a product, to resell, to redistribute (standalone or as a part of a product, such as a book or poster), or any other forms of profit without my permission.</li>
	    <li>Personal usage is allowed, such as in icons, banners, ArtFight pages (with credit), posting online (with credit), printing for personal use (no mass printing), etc., i.e. usage that does not earn you money.</li>
	    <li>For commercial commissions, full attribution is required, and the work may not be resold or redistributed as standalone.</li>
	    <li>You may not claim the commissioned piece as your own work.</li>
	    <li>You may not alter the commissioned piece and redistribute it without my permission.</li>
	    <li>I will most likely share the commission (low res) here on my portfolio, so let me know if you do not want me to do so.</li>
    </ul>
